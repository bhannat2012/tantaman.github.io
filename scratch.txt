// TODO: remove the need for colons in maps.
// TODO: Create a ms macro that will call out what sections of code are being executed.
// the macro takes in an s-expression that represents a program
// and then traverses it, making note of what s-exp has been descended into.
// it then inserts code that publishes an event with the path to the node when that
// node is executed.


// how can we insert the arbitrary call outs?
// (let (x 1) (+ x 2))
// We'd have to be smart about it an insert them at appropriate places with dos
// or just extra expressions.

// template will need to stream results somewhere....
// so we can write while processing.

// also we could use runners to run the compiler in a worker?
